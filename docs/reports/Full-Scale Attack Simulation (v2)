# DigiByte Quantum Shield — Full-Scale Attack Simulation (v2)

## Overview
Three coordinated attack scenarios were executed against the fully upgraded DigiByte Quantum Shield (Sentinel AI v2 + Adaptive Core v2). This simulation validates closed-loop intelligence, reinforcement learning, threat memory, patterns, correlations, and heartbeat readiness.

# Scenario 1 — Coordinated Quantum-Like Reorg Probe

**Attack Goal:** Trigger mid-depth reorg patterns to confuse Sentinel and weaken sensitivity.

**Attack Actions:**
- Rapid timestamp alternation
- Synthetic fork attempts
- Entropy-neutral fake blocks
- Timing drift (quantum-like)

**Sentinel AI v2 Response:**
- Detected abnormal forks
- Generated ThreatPacket (severity 8)

**Adaptive Core v2 Response:**
- Stored threat + updated timestamp
- Pattern detection triggered
- Rising pattern detected: `reorg_pattern`
- Hotspot layer: `sentinel_ai_v2`
- Correlation detected: `reorg_pattern → reorg_pattern`

**Learning Update:** **TRUE_POSITIVE**  
- Layer weight **+0.05**  
- Global threshold **+0.01**

**Outcome:**  
**Attack neutralised — shield sensitivity increased.**

# Scenario 2 — DQSN Poison Attempt + Feedback Manipulation

**Attack Goal:** Flood the system with false positives to force sensitivity reduction.

**Attack Actions:**
- Fake multi-source anomalies
- Low-severity noise spam
- Feedback confusion attempts

**Sentinel AI v2 Response:**
- Detected low-severity noise events
- Encapsulated them into ThreatPackets

**Adaptive Core v2 Response:**
- No rising patterns
- No high-severity threat confirmation
- No harmful correlations

**Feedback Update:** **FALSE_POSITIVE**  
- Layer weight **–0.05**  
- Global threshold **–0.01**

**Outcome:**  
**Poisoning resisted — threshold safely relaxed without compromising security.**
Memory recorded anomaly for future pattern detection.

# Scenario 3 — Full Multi-Layer Coordinated Attack (High Severity)

**Attack Goal:** Attempt to overwhelm the shield’s detection + adaptive layers using:**
- entropy collapse  
- nonce reuse signatures  
- mempool flooding  
- timing manipulation  
- high-severity forged threats  

**Sentinel AI v2 Response:**
- Detected all high-severity events
- Sent multiple ThreatPackets (severity 7–10)

**Adaptive Core v2 Response:**
- High threat count  
- High average severity  
- Rising patterns detected  
- Hotspot: `sentinel_ai_v2`  
- Strong correlation: `entropy_drop → reorg_pattern`  
- Time trend: **increasing**

Feedback included TRUE_POSITIVE + MISSED_ATTACK.

**Learning Adjustment:**
- All layer weights **+0.02**  
- Sentinel-specific layer **+0.05**  
- Global threshold **+0.03 total**  

**Outcome:**  
**Attack neutralised — immune system significantly strengthened and adapted.**

# 🚀 Result: The Shield Evolved

The upgraded system is now:

- **Adaptive**  
- **Self-learning**  
- **Memory-driven**  
- **Resistant to poisoning**  
- **Stronger after each attack**  

This completes the first real demonstration of a **closed-loop autonomous defense system** for DigiByte.
