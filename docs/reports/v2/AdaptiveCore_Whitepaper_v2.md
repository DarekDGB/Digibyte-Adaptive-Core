# 1. Introduction

The DigiByte Adaptive Core is the **sixth and final layer** of the DigiByte Quantum Immune Shield — the system designed to bring DigiByte into the quantum era with an evolving, self-improving defensive architecture.

While the 5 main layers detect, confirm, defend, and protect wallets, the Adaptive Core adds something no blockchain has ever had:

> **A self-learning immune system that becomes stronger with every attack.**

This layer transforms DigiByte from a static security model into a *living organism* with memory, adaptation, and evolution.

---

# 2. Vision

Blockchain security has traditionally relied on:

- fixed rules  
- static algorithms  
- predictable behaviour  

This approach dies the moment a powerful adversary discovers a pattern that the chain cannot defend against.

The Adaptive Core changes that.

It creates an **immune feedback loop** across *all* layers:

```
Detect → Confirm → Defend → Protect → Learn → Reinforce → Detect Stronger
```

Each cycle increases the system’s resilience.

# 3. Architecture Overview

The Adaptive Core integrates with:

- **Sentinel AI v2** (Layer 1)  
- **DQSN v2** (Layer 2)  
- **ADN v2** (Layer 3)  
- **Guardian Wallet v2** (Layer 4)  
- **Quantum Wallet Guard v2** (Layer 5)

It receives threat packets from all of them.

It analyzes:

- behaviour  
- entropy  
- patterns  
- timing  
- clusters  
- signature anomalies  
- wallet actions  
- node reflex events  

And then produces a **Network Immune Response (NIR)**.

# 4. Core Components

## 4.1 Pattern Engine
Learns sequences of attacks and anomalies.  
Detects repeating or evolving structures.

## 4.2 Threat Memory System
Stores long-term threat intelligence.  
Ensures the system **never forgets** dangerous patterns.

## 4.3 Memory Writer
Compresses, prioritizes, rotates and stores patterns.  
Prevents memory bloat while keeping high-value intelligence.

## 4.4 Adaptive Engine
Coordinates learning, scoring, and immune packet generation.

## 4.5 Interface Layer
Connects the Adaptive Core with all other layers.

# 5. Learning Model

The Adaptive Core learns using **incremental reinforcement logic**:

1. **Observe** the event  
2. **Construct** a threat packet  
3. **Score** using short-term memory  
4. **Match** patterns with long-term signatures  
5. **Update** pattern clusters  
6. **Store** if required  
7. **Emit** immune response  

This mirrors biological immunity:

- **First exposure:** low defense  
- **Second exposure:** stronger defense  
- **Third exposure:** instant recognition and high rejection  

---

# 6. Threat Packet Format

Standardized across all 6 layers:

```
{
  "origin": "sentinel | dqsn | adn | guardian | qwg",
  "pattern_hash": "...",
  "severity": 0.0 - 1.0,
  "timestamp": unix,
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

This allows correlation between completely different sources.

---

# 7. Immune Response Packet

Returned back to all 5 layers:

```
{
  "immune_score": 0.0 - 1.0,
  "level": "LOW | ELEVATED | HIGH | CRITICAL",
  "reinforced_patterns": [...],
  "actions": [...]
}
```

ADN may respond with lockdown.  
Wallet layers may freeze suspicious transactions.  
DQSN may raise network-level severity.

---

# 8. System Behaviour under Attack

During multi-layer coordinated attacks:

- pattern engine triggers early  
- threat memory recalls previous structures  
- scores rise faster  
- immune response severity increases  
- defensive layers react more aggressively  

Each attack leaves a **memory signature** making future attacks harder.

---

# 9. Reports Included

The Adaptive Core includes:

- Full-scale attack simulations  
- Immune system learning reports  
- Long-term pattern evolution analysis  

These demonstrate:

- how memory grows  
- how patterns merge  
- how severity calibration evolves  
- how defenses strengthen  

---

# 10. Why This Matters

This is the first blockchain immune system that:

- learns  
- adapts  
- evolves  
- remembers  
- strengthens over time  

While other blockchains wait for “the next hard fork,”  
DigiByte becomes an **active, self-evolving defender**.

---

# 11. Status: COMPLETE (v2)

The Adaptive Core is:

- fully implemented  
- fully tested  
- CI green  
- fully documented  
- ready for orchestration in the merged shield  

---

# 12. Future Work

- PQC signature pattern learning  
- deeper entropy-based threat clustering  
- integration with GPU inference for faster pattern scoring  
- cross-chain immune intelligence exchange  

---

# 13. Conclusion

DarekDGB’s Adaptive Core is not an upgrade.

It is an **evolution step** for blockchain cybersecurity.

A living immune system for DigiByte.

A foundation for the quantum era.
